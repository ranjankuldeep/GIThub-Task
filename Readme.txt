Being an developer enthusiast , I wish to join the coding club to learn and compete .

open source
I want to contribute in open source as I feel like there is big family of developers out there , each contributing their knowledge and skill to make a project which is useful to vast users free of cost.
We can see how the vlc media player as an open source project is so widely used ,, that’s the power of open source contribution . Even google is aware of this huge potential an open source contribution has and that’s the reason it conducts GOOGLE SUMMER OF CODE  every year to promote open source .
It  is also satisfying to see how my feature implemented in the open source project helps lot of user and make their life easy .
You learn a lot , meet new peoples , share your knowledge , gain their knowledge , it is quite interesting and fun at the same time .
